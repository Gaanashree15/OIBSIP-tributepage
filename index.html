The INA's battle cry resonated with soldiers who hailed from diverse backgrounds, united by their shared dream of a liberated India.                     
            While the physical presence of Netaji may have faded from the world, his legacy continues to burn bright in the hearts of millions. His call for "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom" ignited a flame of dedication among Indians, inspiring countless individuals to make sacrifices for the nation's greater good.
            <br>Netaji's early life was marked by his pursuit of education, which instilled in him a passion for learning and a deep sense of national pride. After completing his schooling in Cuttack and Calcutta, he enrolled at the prestigious Presidency College, where his intellect and leadership skills began to shine. His journey eventually led him to Cambridge University, where he imbibed a broader perspective on the world and its political dynamics.
